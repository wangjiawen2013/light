# Light - A declarative statistical visualization library for Rust
Light has native support for [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) and uses the powerful [Vega-Lite](https://altair-viz.github.io/) grammar, simplifying the process of creating visualizations from dataframes. It also adopts [GraphPad Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/) themes, allowing you to generate publication quality plots.
Light is very much a work in progress, so suggestions for new tools, features and capabilities is very much welcome, as are contributions as PRs.
