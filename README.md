# Light - A declarative statistical visualization library for Rust
Light is a drawing library designed for rendering figures, plots, and charts, in pure Rust, using SVG as drawing backend.
* Light has native support for [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), simplifying the process of creating visualizations from dataframes.
* Light is built on top of the the powerful [Vega-Lite](https://altair-viz.github.io/) grammar, empowering you to spend less time writing code and more time exploring your data.
* Light adopts [GraphPad Prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/) themes, enabling you to generate publication quality plots.
* Light seamlessly integrates with Jupyter Notebooks, allowing you to leverage the power of interactive data visualization directly within your notebook environment through [evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr).

Light is very much a work in progress, so suggestions for new tools, features and capabilities is very much welcome, as are contributions as PRs.
